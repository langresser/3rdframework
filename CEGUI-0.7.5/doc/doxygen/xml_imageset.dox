@page xml_imageset Imageset XML files.

An Imageset is a collection of named regions upon some source surface, such as
an image file or texture.  In CEGUI terminology, each of these named regions is
an Image and is the basic level of imagery used by CEGUI.

@section xml_imageset_overview Overview
The reference for each element is arranged into sections, as described below:
- Purpose:
    - This section describes what the elements general purpose is within the
      specifications.

- Attributes:
    - This section describes available attributes for the elements, and whether
      they are required or optional.

- Usage:
    - Describes where the element may appear, whether the element may have
      sub-elements, and other important usage information.

- Examples:
    - For many elements, this section will contain brief examples showing the
      element used in context.


<br>
@section xml_imageset_imageset \<Imageset\> Element
- Purpose:
    - The \<Imageset\> element is the root element in XML imageset definition
    files.

- Attributes:
    - @c Name: Specifies the name that will be assigned to the Imageset in the
      CEGUI system.  Required Attribute.
    - @c Imagefile: Specifies the path to the image file containing the imagery 
      for the imageset.  Required attribute.
    - @c ResourceGroup: Specifies the resource group identifier to pass to the
      ResourceProvider when loading the file given in the @c Imagefile
      attribute.  Optional attribute, default is the Imageset default group.
    - @c AutoScaled: Boolean property that states whether to scale imagery so
      it appears the same @e physical size at any resolution.  The specified
      native resolution values indicate the resolution that will result in a
      one-to-one (i.e. unscaled) mapping from source to destination.  At
      resolutions higher than the native, the imagery will be scaled @e up to
      take up more space, and at resolutions lower than the native, the imagery
      will be scaled @e down to take up less space.
      Optional attribute, default is false.
    - @c NativeHorzRes: When AutoScaled is enabled, specifies the horizontal
      screen resolution that will result in an unscaled, one-to-one mapping of
      pixels from the source image to the destination surface.
      Optional attribute, default is 640.
    - @c NativeVertRes: When AutoScaled is enabled, specifies the vertical
      screen resolution that will result in an unscaled, one-to-one mapping of
      pixels from the source image to the destination surface.
      Optional attribute, default is 480.

- Usage:
    - The \<Imageset\> element is the root element for imageset files. 
    - The \<Imageset\> element may contain any number of \<Image\> elements. 
    - No element may contain \<Imageset\> elements as a sub-element.

- Examples:

<br>
@section xml_imageset_image \<Image> Element
- Purpose:
    - Defines a single component image of an imageset.

- Attributes:
    - @c Name: Specifies the name that will be used to identify the image within
      the Imageset.  Required attribute.
    - @c XPos: Specifies the X pixel co-ordinate of the top-left corner of the
      image on the source surface.  Required attribute.
    - @c YPos: Specifies the Y pixel co-ordinate of the top-left corner of the
      image on the source surface.  Required attribute.
    - @c Width: Specifies the width of the image in pixels.
      Required attribute.
    - @c Height: Specifies the height of the image in pixels.
      Required attibute.
    - @c XOffset: Specifies a horizontal offset to apply when rendering the
      image.  Optional attribute, default is 0.
    - @c YOffset: Specifies a vertical offset to apply when rendering the
      image.  Optional attribute, default is 0.

- Usage:
    - The \<Image\> element may only appear as a sub-element of the \<Imageset\>
    element.
    - The \<Image\> element may not contain any sub-elements.

- Examples:
